This project is about an online shopping platform for clothes, called "Wardrobe".

Structure:
This application uses Springboot and Hibernate, also applying part of Spring MVC structure.

Deployment:
You need a DB and a folder on the desktop to run the application.
DB should be anyone that is applicable to Hibernate. Remember to change the setting of your DB in the Application.java.
This is because when generating the session of Hibernate, DB info is necessary.
Also the folder can be deployed anywhere and remember to copy its path to the application.properties.
If there is something wrong with the file uploading, please check whether the current role of your computer has the right to modify any folder in you computer.

If you have any question, you can get in touch with me through email.
